DESCRIPTION
DEAR
ALL
AFTER
EXTENSIVE
RESEARCH
ON
PROJECT
MANAGEMENT
I
HAVE
COME
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
THERE
IS
A
FUNDAMENTAL
THEORYMETHOD
MISSING
FOR
NONPROJECT
MANAGERS
TO
ENGAGE
WITH
PROJECT
MANAGEMENT
EVERY
INDIVIDUAL
UNCONSCIOUSLY
PRACTICES
PROJECT
MANAGEMENT
ON
A
CERTAIN
LEVEL
DAILY
OFTEN
IN
THE
FORM
OF
PROBLEMSOLVING
WHY
DONT
WE
MAKE
THESE
INDIVIDUALS
AWARE
THAT
WHAT
THEY
DO
DAILY
IS
ALSO
APPLICABLE
TO
WORK
BY
ESTABLISHING
A
CONNECTION
BETWEEN
DAILY
PROBLEMSOLVING
AND
PROJECT
MANAGEMENT
WE
CAN
RAISE
AWARENESS
FOR
PROJECT
MANAGEMENT
AS
EMPLOYEES
GRASP
THE
THEORY
BEHIND
PROJECT
MANAGEMENT
THEMSELVES
LESS
ATTENTION
NEEDS
TO
BE
DEVOTED
TO
IT
THIS
COULD
POTENTIALLY
LEAD
TO
BETTERFUNCTIONING
PROJECT
TEAMS
AND
CONSEQUENTLY
BETTER
PROJECTS
WHEN
THE
CONCEPT
TRULY
CLICKS
WITH
EMPLOYEES
IT
CAN
EVEN
LEAD
TO
SELFMANAGING
TEAMS
RESULTING
IN
COST
SAVINGS
IN
BOTH
OUTCOMES
THE
COMPONENTS
OF
THE
BASIC
THEORYMETHOD
ARE
PRESENT
IN
ALMOST
EVERY
EXISTING
METHODOLOGY

AS
AGILE
WATERFALL
IMP
PRINCE2
ETC
THE
FOUR

PROJECT

STAKEHOLDERS
AND
ASSESSING
FEASIBILITY

PLANNING
THIS
ENCOMPASSES

A
DETAILED
PLAN
TO
ACHIEVE
THE
PROJECTS
OBJECTIVES

PROJECT
SCOPE
CREATING
A
TIMELINE
ALLOCATING
PERSONNEL
BUDGET
AND
MATERIAL
RESOURCES
IDENTIFYING
POTENTIAL
RISKS
AND
ESTABLISHING
A
COMMUNICATION
PLAN

MONITORING
AND
CONTROL
THIS
INVOLVES
TRACKING
THE
PROJECTS
PROGRESS
AND
INTERVENING
WHEN
NECESSARY
PROGRESS
CAN
BE
MONITORED
THROUGH
REFLECTION
MOMENTS
OR
BY
REQUIRING
DOCUMENTATION

CLOSING
THE
FINAL
COMPONENT
INVOLVES
TRANSFERRING
THE
PROJECT
