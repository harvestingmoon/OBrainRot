Title: I pooped during my run yesterday
Description: So I was about half way through my run yesterday morning, it was about 7am and I had been battling a shit for about 40 mins prior. I was cramping so bad and trying to hold my butt hole closed as tight as humanly possible because it was going to coming out, I had NO choice but to let it. I was running along the side of a small highway and spotted a (mostly) covered/secluded bush. If It was later in the morning someone definitely would have seen me but it was the best I could find, other wise it was going down my leg. 

The second I dropped my shorts it just came out in one huge steaming pile. I could smell it and it was horrendous. Worse than a dead animal, I mean like it actually looked like the ðŸ’© emoji. I was both impressed and appalled with myself. Thankfully I was wearing a running vest with squeezie water bottles so yeah I had to create a make shift bidet essentially. 

Itâ€™s been eating me up for the last 24hrs and I canâ€™t tell my husband because I already told him I had to pee in a bush on my run (which I also did earlier in the session) and he literally cringed at me ðŸ˜‚ Iâ€™m so embarrassed, itâ€™s the most vile thing I have ever done!
