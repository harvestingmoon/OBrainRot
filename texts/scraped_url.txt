Title: I’ve come to the realization that when I was a teenager, I was a predator
Description: When I was a teenager, I was a predator. 

Many years ago, I was a horrible kid. 

I had bad insecurities. Went thru some minor trauma. And I hated myself. Specifically, I hated my body. Not hitting puberty til after I was 15. Not growing til 16. 

When that happened, I lost my mind. I showed my junk to younger kids. I sexted and went on Omegle, talking to other teens older and younger. I found illegal content on Omegle. I watched it.

In college, I finally talked to girls. I slept with 40 of em. I cheated. I kept sexting.

Now, I’m older. Sure I guess wiser. Because I’m wiser, I’m appalled at who I was. 

I won’t mention sui—-. But I think about it all the time. I never assaulted anyone. I never raped anyone. I never touched anyone.

But I was a sexual maniac as a teenager.

If people knew I’d be ruined. 

If my work knew I’d be fired.

If my friends knew they’d ghost me.

If my family knew they’d disown me.

If I was caught, I’d be in jail.
 
I hate myself.
