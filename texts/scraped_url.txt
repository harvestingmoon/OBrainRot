Title: AITA, Am I in the wrong for being mad about the people being close to me not telling me they think I could have bipolar?
Description: I (18 F)  have been going to therapy for a good while now, and at my most recent session, my therapist (39 M) asked me an odd question. I was telling him about how I don't really  sleep all the often, or I sleep to much, and just my mood swings, and some paranoia I've been dealing with. After all that was laid on the table he asked me if I was Bi-Polar, and to me that was an odd question, because I've never thought of that being a possibility until he brought it up. so when I arrived at home I asked my sister (22 F) what she thought about it, and she said she wouldn't be surprised if I had some type of mood disorder. And now I am obsessing over this, and have been taking online quizzes, and looking things up in medical journals, and diagnostic books. I don't see my therapist for another week or so because he is going on vacation with his family, and I don't really have anyone with experience with this type of thing to ask about this.  So, am I wrong to be annoyed that no one told me their suspicions?
